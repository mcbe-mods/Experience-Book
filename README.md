## Download

To download, you need to go to the GitHub repository [releases](https://github.com/mcbe-mods/Experience-Book/releases)

## Usage

> Theoretically, if you download [Experience-Book-1.20.4-v1.0.3.mcaddon](https://github.com/mcbe-mods/Experience-Book/releases/tag/v1.0.3) it should work correctly in all future releases greater than or equal to `1.20.40`, since it uses the `Script API` of the `1.6.0` official release, and is no longer the `Script API Beta`.

> required enable Beta API
>
>Each experience book can only store up to 30 levels of experience (1395 experience points)
>
>For more information about experience points, please see: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience#Leveling_up

## LICENSE

Please note that the open source license is GPL-2.0 and you should strictly adhere to it.

- Why is it GPL-2.0 license?
- Because I had a lot of trouble developing this mod, and I wanted to learn from it or see how others wrote it, but all I saw was ugly or obfuscated JavaScript code, and I hope that every minecraft player or minecraft mod developer will make the source code public so that more people can learn and make the mod, making the minecraft community community more active and make minecraft more playable. Of course, I also hope that when you borrow someone else's code or other content, you mark it with the author's name, **please respect every open source mod author!**
